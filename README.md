# About

This is a function depo. That is to say, I collect functions here that might
be useful way down the line. There is no restrictions on programming languages,
but I would generally avoid propriety languages, like Matlab, and would
definitely prefer scripting languages, like stuff that need no compiling.

# Rules

Because it is not only for programmers, but for anyone using these languages
for writing experiments, doing data analysis... I came up with some rules to
make everything tidy.

* **Filenames** should be straightforward, contain no spaces and have less then or
equal to 12 characters,
* **Line-length** is set to 80 characters.
* **Comment your code, you philistine!!!!**
* **Descriptions** of what each function does have to be inserted before the code. **Subfunctions** should be preceded with a description of what they are there to do.
* **Folder structure** us semi-random and is in development.
* **List** your function below and provide a few words, so we know what it is.
